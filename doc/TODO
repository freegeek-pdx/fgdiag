fgdiag release management
=========================
 - make Debian package

Non-FreekBox Projects
=====================
	Create a fax testing procedure using dial tone emulator

Network Devices
===============
 NICs, hubs, and switches - currently we don't have a testing program
   which puts any of  these under load.

 netpipe may be useful in testing all sorts of network devices under
   load.

 General:
   - Find out about netpipe integrity check mode, either by reading
      source code or asking the authors.

 NIC testing:
 - write stories for NIC testing
 - write tests for NIC testing
 - write code for NIC testing
 - update NIC Testing HOWTO

 Hub/switch testing:
 - write stories for hub testing
 - write stories for switch testing
 - write tests for hub testing
 - write tests for switch testing
 - write code for hub testing
 - write code for switch testing
 - write the Hub/Switch Testing HOWTO

 Bonus:
 - decide if you want to display pretty pictures from netpipe and gnuplot.

 Netpipe:

   Debian package: netpipe-tcp

SMART Hard Drives
=================

   There is a thing called SMART which may be a faster, more reliable,
   and less damaging method of testing hard drives for those drives
   which implement it.  We should build a SMART-based drive tester
   and, when possible, use it instead of the badblocks-based one.

   See Debian package "smartmontools" and the manpage for "smartctl".

Enhancements:
=============
	Video -- better support for AGP cards 
	Sound -- support for non-SB modules
	Sound -- checking MPU_IO and DMA resources
	Monitor -- better display of resolution string 
		(before and after and during? tests)
	Monitor -- there should be a burn in test that leaves the
		monitor running for a longer period of time, and an instant
		test that can determine a bad monitor in seconds. The instant
		test might be running on a couple machines at receiving.  The
		burn in test could run on a couple machines in the store.
	CD -- ?? 
	NIC -- Test transfer of data over wires
	Hard Drive -- report drive geometry?
	Floppy Drive -- dd an image to a floppy (from HD) and 
		boot from it (for in an existing FreekBox)
	Modem -- dial in to another modem (on server) and 
		check for speed and data corruption 
	Modem -- make an EXTERNAL mode -- this shouldn't report the
		serial port (irrelevant) and should allow user to plug in a
		new modem without power cycling.

FGDiag Lib
===========
 - Simplify FieldMap lookups of many fields by turning into single query e.g. SELECT foo FROM fieldMap WHERE tablename IN ('class', 'class', 'class') AND fieldname IN ("foofield", "barfield")
 - Curses Gui
 - Any other possible optimizations
 - Way for testing scripts to override test order?
