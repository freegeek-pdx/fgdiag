Getting hardware testing to the next level:

Non-FreekBox Projects
=====================
	Create a fax testing procedure using dial tone emulator

Enhancements:
=============
	Video -- better support for AGP cards 
	Sound -- support for non-SB modules
	Sound -- checking MPU_IO and DMA resources
	Monitor -- better display of resolution string 
		(before and after and during? tests)
	Monitor -- there should be a burn in test that leaves the
		monitor running for a longer period of time, and an instant
		test that can determine a bad monitor in seconds. The instant
		test might be running on a couple machines at receiving.  The
		burn in test could run on a couple machines in the store.
	CD -- ?? 
	NIC -- Test transfer of data over wires
	Hard Drive -- report drive geometry?
	Hard Drive -- install a file system
        Hard Drive -- when finished, report summary of drive, size, pass/fail
	Floppy Drive -- dd an image to a floppy (from HD) and 
		boot from it (for in an existing FreekBox)
	Modem -- dial in to another modem (on server) and 
		check for speed and data corruption 
	Modem -- make an EXTERNAL mode -- this shouldn't report the
		serial port (irrelevant) and should allow user to plug in a
		new modem without power cycling.
