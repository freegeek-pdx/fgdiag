Files to know and love:

  ChangeLog - Did you change something?  Log it!

  Makefile - currently used mostly to set the execute bits which CVS loses.

  README - Have you read it?

  HACKING - This file, for people working the code.

  todo - Things to do.

Coding standards:

For Python, http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html is a good guide.
Don't use tabs.  Use four spaces.


Files of code:

Python stuff:

__init__.py - defines this directory as a Python package

Disk tester:
  cursesdisk.py - front-end
  badblocks.py - badblocks wrapper
  disk.py - wrapper for various and sundry linux disk things
  selftest/cursesnodisk - lets you run cursesdisk without really writing
    over any drives.
  selftest/fauxblocks - shim for badblocks, used by cursesnodisk
  selftest/test_syslog.py - unit tests for syslog parsing

Modem tester:
  modem.py - tries to get modems to tell their speed
  pcimodem.py - looks for PCI modems
  isapnp.py - looks for PNP cards (also used by NIC tester)
  selftest/test_modem.py - unit tests for modem.py

Keyboard tester:
  keyboard.py - keyboard tester
  keyboard_data.py - constants used by keyboard tester

Misc:
  meminfo.py - interface to /proc/meminfo, sometimes used by disk tester
  pyutil.py - miscellanious, used by modem tester, but not modem-specific
