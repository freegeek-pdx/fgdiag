  ChangeLog - Did you change something?  Log it!

  README - Have you read it?

  HACKING - This file, for people working the code.

  TODO - Things to do.

Coding standards:

For Python, http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html is a good guide.
Don't use tabs.  Use four spaces.

Tests:

Always make sure the tests pass before you check in code!
Execute 'admin/runtests' and make sure it says OK.
(It requires twisted.trial to run.)

Other useful tools to run over your Python code are pychecker, pylint
and pyflakes.  The difference between these tools is in their verbosity;
pychecker checks for many more things but often raises many false alarms,
pyflakes is very conservative.

Developer and maintainer tools are in the admin/ subdirectory:

  runtests   - runs the test suite.
  runepydoc  - makes HTML versions of the API documentation.
  tagversion - tags or checks out a version for production use.

Files of code:

Python stuff:

__init__.py - defines this directory as a Python package

Disk tester:
  cursesdisk.py - front-end
  badblocks.py - badblocks wrapper
  disk.py - wrapper for various and sundry linux disk things
  selftest/cursesnodisk - lets you run cursesdisk without really writing
    over any drives.
  selftest/fauxblocks - shim for badblocks, used by cursesnodisk
  selftest/test_syslog.py - unit tests for syslog parsing

Modem tester:
  modem.py - tries to get modems to tell their speed
  pcimodem.py - looks for PCI modems
  isapnp.py - looks for PNP cards (also used by NIC tester)
  selftest/test_modem.py - unit tests for modem.py

Keyboard tester:
  keyboard.py - keyboard tester
  keyboard_data.py - constants used by keyboard tester

Misc:
  meminfo.py - interface to /proc/meminfo, sometimes used by disk tester
  pyutil.py - miscellanious, used by modem tester, but not modem-specific
