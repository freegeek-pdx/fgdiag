GENERIC PURPOSE OF A TESTING STATION
==================================== 

Each testing station should have one purpose -- to sort gizmos
into three groups:

	RECYCLE: Gizmos to be recycled (old, obsolete, or failed test)
	STORE: Gizmos to be stored (passed test)
	EXPERT: Needs expert attention (could be Gizmo worth
	repairing, collectable, etc.)

Ideally, the EXPERT group will be small and the STORE and RECYCLE
piles will be accurate.

The process of doing this may entail more than one step.
For instance, it may be necessary to configure a gizmo before
it is able to be tested (or after testing but before storage).
In these cases there may need to be a configuration step as
well as a testing step, so the outflow of the testing station
might be:

	RECYCLE: Gizmos to be recycled (old, obsolete, or failed test)
	STORE: Gizmos to be stored (passed test and standard config)
	CONFIGURE: Gizmos needing to be configured before storage
	or re-testing.
	EXPERT: Needs expert attention (could be Gizmo worth
	repairing, collectable, etc.)

Additionally, the STORE box might need to be subdivided into
more than one category. There may be storage requirements
(as in INTERNAL MODEMS vs. EXTERNAL MODEMS) or different
classes of gizmos, defined by what we can and cannot use
them for. For instance the modem testing station currently
should look like this:

	RECYCLE: Modems to be recycled (14.4 or lower, or failed test)
	CONFIGURE: Modems capable of being flash upgraded to 56K. 
	WINMODEMS: Winmodems are useless to FreekBox builders, but 
	might be sold.
	PLUG 'N' PLAY: PnP modems are more difficult to work with
	and should be sold unless we run out of tested non-PnP ones.
	INTERNAL: Internal modems to be stored (passed test, but not
	flashable, nor PnP, nor winmodem)
	EXTERNAL: External modems to be stored for FreekBox building. 
	EXPERT: Needs expert attention (could be modem worth
	repairing, collectable, etc.)

PHYSICAL LAYOUT OF A TESTING STATION
====================================

The physical areas for each testing station need to have a space
for three stages in the testing cycle, depending on what process
they are waiting for:

	TO BE TESTED
	TO BE RECYCLED
	TO BE STORED
	TO BE EVALUATED BY AN EXPERT

These may be temporary holding areas, for example a milk crate
sized box for cards in each category. But, there need to be
instructions showing where final storage and recycling is. In some
cases (for instance monitors which are large) the Gizmos will need
to be moved immediately upon testing to storage or recycling.

RESPONSIBLE PERSON
==================

There needs to be a responsible person for each area. This
person's job is to know how the station runs (hardware, software,
and testing process). The responsible person's name needs to be
posted at the station.

INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPERTS LIST
=============================

Written instructions should be available at every testing area. 
The instructions should be easy enough for an average worker to 
follow after they have been explained once by a staff member or 
experienced tester.  The instructions should describe how to 
test the Gizmos at that station and how to sort into the three 
main categories above.

Included in the instructions should be a list of experts, people
who are familiar with the testing process and are capable of
evaluating the Gizmos left in the EXPERT holding area.

Instructions should be checked into CVS as a part of FREE GEEK's
main HOWTO heirarchy.

ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

Intended for experts, the advanced instructions should include
notes on how to rebuild the machine if it fails or a second one
is needed. Special hardware needs and BIOS settings should be
included. The BIOS settings should be in a separate section,
since it is likely they will be needed even if a new machine
does not need to be rebuilt.

SOFTWARE
========

All software for the testing station should be checked into CVS.
This includes the scripts that test or configure the gizmo,
kernel configuration files, scripts for testing the test software,
and install or update scripts.

HARDWARE ZOO
============

Specimens of each category of gizmo need to be placed in a
hardware "zoo" at FREE GEEK. This zoo should contain examples
of gizmos that will pass and fail in known ways. This allows
us to try the testing procedure and see if it works as expected.

TALLY SHEETS
============

Each testing station should have printed tally sheets made
available. The tally sheets should have columns for failed Gizmos
(perhaps with subcolumns for common reasons for failure), and
passed Gizmos (with subcolumns for various attributes about the
Gizmo). As Gizmos are tested their Gizmo ID numbers and the
relevant information are recorded in each column. When testing is
finished, the tester (or a person in the recieving area) can 
enter the information into the database. Tally sheets should
be pre-printed for consistency.
