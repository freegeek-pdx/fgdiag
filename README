This is a place for all hardware testing
scripts used by FREE GEEK.

There's some documentation in the "doc" subdirectory:

testing-purpose.txt -- describes the Purpose of a Testing Station and
        establishes standards for software and procedure.  It also contains a
        list of currently operational testing stations, and those which are
        desired.

HACKING -- for those working on the code.

Here are the scripts developed so far:

common.sh -- common script that decides which custom
             script to run, based on a parameter passed
             in from the kernel (change parameter in
             lilo.conf if necessary)

cursesdisk.py -- script for testing hard drives.  It scans
             for plugged-in but unmounted hard drives, checks
             for a Compaq partition, and then serves as a front-end
             to badblocks while watching the kernel log.

modem.py --  script for testing modems. talks to each 
             serial port and tries to find a modem.
             when found, queries the modem for all
             available information and interprets
             returned strings looking for likely signs
             of the modems speeds. does not actually 
             connect to another modem.

nicky.sh --  script for detecting ISA ethernet cards
             and their resource settings (i/o, irq)

isapnp.py -- script for detecting ISA PnP devices
