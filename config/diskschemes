# default partitioning schemes

# TODO support more than four disk partitions on each disk
# TODO ability to define a partition type only once (swap,root)
# TODO free/empty/unpartitioned partition type

#diskN_P where N is the disk(order is like grub), and P is the partition
#number (may not directly translate to linux partition types)
# "mount" is the mount point
# "fstype" is the filesystem type, must have writeable linux support to
# work
# "type" determines mount options: choices are normal, boot, root, swap
# "min" is minimum partition size
# "max" is maximum partition size, 
# sizes are in megabytes by default, or a multiple of the
# memory size (Nmem). "remainder" is space left when other
# partitions have been allocated a size.
